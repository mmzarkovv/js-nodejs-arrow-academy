# Final Project

As an outcome of this Academy we are going to make a final end to end project. Here are details about this:

* There will be one main project maintained by the Lectors here https://github.com/pltod2/braggers

* Each person will have its own repo for the final project

* Each person could evolve the project on its own

* If particular feature is considered good, a PR to the lectors' project could be made

* Please stick to the proposed technology set

> MongoDB / Express / React / Webpack ecosystem

* Strive for writing reusable modules that could be published in npm

* Each project could be deployed in the cloud for showcase purposes with tools like https://zeit.co/now
