Why is a good idea to learn JavaScript? 

1. The most suitable language you can use to become a developer on the first place.

2. The most suitable language you can use to become FULL STACK developer

You can use it in the browser, on the server, or to read data from databases

3. The most suitable language to make both WEB and MOBILE applications

4. If you know the language you will be able to understand web frameworks like jQuery / Backbone / Angular / React and platforms like Node.js

5. HTML5 is mostly functionality implemented in JavaScript. When you know the language you will be able to understand better how browsers work.

6. The most suitable language to make an application once and to run it on any platform -> Windows / Linux / macOS / iOS / Android etc.

7. The most popular language in Github (millions of developers use GitHub to build personal projects, support their businesses, and work together on open source technologies.) 

See the statistics at http://githut.info/

8. More than 100 other languages compile to JavaScript (https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS)
This means that you can use JavaScript directly for the same purpose that these languages are used for.

9. Any of the large companies is using it - Facebook / Google / Uber / Microsoft / Netflix  

10. Finally JavaScript makes your life as developer simple - you are doing many things with the same tool.
